                    The Flood Damage Reduction Analysis (HEC-FDA) software is distributed publicly through the Hydrologic Engineering Center website (

                    ) when it is determined to be ready for general use. Each new release is assigned a version number. The production of a new release begins with the specification of new features and proceeds through the development cycle stages of design, implementation, testing, documentation, release engineering, and certification. A new release that has not completed all of these stages is considered interim software and is indicated as such by appending a suffix like "alpha" or "beta" to the version number. Documentation that has not completed the technical review process is marked as "draft."
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    The Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) works with software users during the software development cycle. Though every effort is made to release software with no errors, users may from time to time discover issues in the software that were not detected during the development cycle. HEC will engage with users to reproduce reported errors. Solutions will be designed, implemented, and tested. Interim software may be provided to the user as part of the testing process so that the user may verify that the solution is effective in resolving the error. Appropriate test cases based on the user's data set may be added to the standard validation test cases used to certify a new software release. It is important that interim software and draft documentation be kept confidential.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    HEC will provide interim software and draft documentation for a user with the following restrictions kept in place until the general release occurs:
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    1. HEC and the software user will work collaboratively to achieve the shared goal of improving the next general release by eliminating errors from the software.
                    The interim software and draft documentation are for the sole use of the user.
                    <LineBreak/>
                    2. The interim software and draft documentation should not be shared with others.
                    <LineBreak/>
                    3. The user will return comments to HEC on validation and verification testing of the interim software so that the software may be improved before general release.
                    <LineBreak/>
                    4. The user will return comments to HEC on the review of the draft documentation so that the documentation may be improved before general release.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    Interim software has not been subjected to the same level of testing as the general release. Therefore, the following activities are never permitted with interim software even after the general release occurs:
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    1. Results produced with the interim software cannot ever be used in final engineering design studies or project reports.
                    <LineBreak/>
                    2. Results produced with the interim software cannot ever be used in final permit applications.
                    <LineBreak/>
                    3. Results produced with the interim software cannot ever be submitted to an academic or professional journal.
                    <LineBreak/>
                    4. Results produced with the interim software cannot ever be presented at a conference or workshop.
                    <LineBreak/>
                    5. Results produced with the interim software cannot ever be submitted as part of a final thesis or dissertation.

                <Paragraph>
                    Any work product developed with the interim software must be updated using the final released software.
